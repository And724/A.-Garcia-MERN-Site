# Fullstack MERN Site
This project is the culmination of the technologies learned in my Web Development course. On the website there is a Single Page Application (SPA) that is taking advantage of MongoDB, Express, React v18, Node, JavaScript, and conforms to REST design principles. The other pages of the website take advantage of some of these technologies in addition to HTML and CSS. The SPA on the website logs data in a table that a user can interact with and that page interacts with MongoDB. 

# Usage
Clone this repository to your computer and ensure you have a way to connect with a database via MongoDB. I achieved this by using MongoDB Atlas and using their free option to create a cluster. Once that is done, I added my MongoDB account username and password to the backend folder's .env file. Connecting to MongoDB is necessary for the SPA to function properly. Download the needed dependencies. Once setup, right click on the frontend folder in your IDE and open in integrated terminal. In the terminal, type `npm start`. Do the same for the backend folder in your IDE. Now you can fully interact with the site!





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
